This the repository where I store my self-projects dealing with cryptography.

For the moment I added a folder "DH" on the **Diffie-Hellmann** key exchange protocol where we can find multiple methods to find the key :
- Bruteforce
- Pollard's rho
- Baby steps giant step (BSGS)

One can also find the "ECDH" folder where I implemented the Diffie-Hellmann key exchange protocol on **eliptic curves** with the same adapted methods :
- Bruteforce
- Baby steps giant step (BSGS)
